                Immortalize your loved one in a semi realistic painting using media of your choice i.e Oil Paints, Soft Pastels, Acrylics etc. I will only settle for the best quality because, I know how important it is for the portrait to be perfect.<br /><br />


                In order to get the best quality work, I need good quality photos. If photos
                are not of good quality, we might have to compromise on the quality of work. I understand how hard it is to get a good picture of our little ones, please do try your best.<br /><br />

                <h3>Steps for ordering:</h3>

                Email or send a message on whatsapp, good quality photos of the subject and perhaps any separate photos of backgrounds or other subject matter you may want to be included. If you want more than one subject in the painting, they don't need to be in the same photo, I can put them together. I can also paint Pets with their owners.<br /><br />

                I will create a composite using the photos in photoshop to see exactly how things will look and will send the composite to you and make changes if need be. If you are satisfied, I will accept the commission on receipt of a non-refundable 50% deposit which will be subtracted from the total cost once the painting is completed.<br /><br />


                Once I have completed the painting, I will photograph it and email the photo to you. If you are satisfied with the painting, I will then send the painting to you on receipt of the outstanding amount left to pay.<br /><br />

                Starting prices apply for a head and neck portrait with simple background colour. Prices rise with more complexed backgrounds, full body portraits, additional subjects or smaller studies along with a main portrait. If you require another size or would like anything other than the standard head and neck portrait, feel free to contact me with details for a quotation.<br /><br />
